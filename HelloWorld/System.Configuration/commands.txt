dotnet new console

dotnet publish -c Release -o /opt/HelloWorld
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl start HelloWorld 
sudo systemctl status HelloWorld
sudo journalctl -u HelloWorld -f

Service will restart in case of crash. 
But when OS reboots, the application will not 
automatically start. 
To enable automatic startup of the service on boot, 
run following command:
sudo systemctl enable HelloWorld


dotnet new worker 


####################################
Microsoft recently added a package to better integrate with 
systemd. The .NET core application will notify systemd when it's 
ready and when it's stopping. Additionally, systemd will now 
understand the different log levels when .NET Core application logs to 
output. 
Using the dotnet CLI, add the 
Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd (nuget) package 

dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd --version 3.1.1

sudo journalctl -u Worker -f -p 4


The 'UseSystemd' function will not do anything when run 
outside of a systemd service. The implementation checks if the 
OS is a Unix system and whether the parent process is systemd. 
If not, the systemd integration is skipped.
