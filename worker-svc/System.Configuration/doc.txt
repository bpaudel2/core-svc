Program.cs 
The host is responsible for application startup 
and lifetime management. CreateDefaultBuilder creates this 
runtime host to run the application. CreateDefaultBuilder does a 
few things; configuring Kestrel server, set the root 
directory, load app configuration( appsettings.json, appsettings.[Environment].json), 
and configure logging. 

Worker.cs
This is the background worker which does the actual job. 

Run as Windows Service:
In order to run as a Windows Service we need our worker to 
listen for the start and stop signals from ServiceBase, the .NET type 
that exposes the Windows Service systems to .NET applications. 
To do this we want to add the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices NuGet package.

# ADD UseWindowsService() call to the host builder 


Run as Linux Daemon
Add Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Systemd NuGet 
package (please note that you need .NET Core SDK 
Preview7+ for this).

#Add UseSystemd() call to host builder.
